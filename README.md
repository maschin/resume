# Résumé
My very own personal website. Basically this is just a résumé.

You can view this site at <https://maschin.github.io/resume/>.
 
I created this project for the online up to date resume. It is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

For [Resume/CV template](https://creativemarket.com/bilmaw/1103520-ResumeCV-Anderson/screenshots/#screenshot1) I used work's made by 
[Bill Mawhinney](https://dribbble.com/bilmaw) (screen shot).  

#### I used the next technologies and frameworks:
* HTML5
* CSS
* Bootstrap v4.0 https://getbootstrap.com/
* Font-Awesome https://fontawesome.com/
* Rubik font [https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik]
