I created this project for the online up to date resume.

For [Resume/CV template](https://creativemarket.com/bilmaw/1103520-ResumeCV-Anderson/screenshots/#screenshot1) I used work's made by 
[Bill Mawhinney](https://dribbble.com/bilmaw) (screen shot).  

#### I used the next technologies and frameworks:
* HTML5
* CSS
* Bootstrap v4.2 https://getbootstrap.com/
* Font-Awesome https://fontawesome.com/
* Rubik font [https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik]
